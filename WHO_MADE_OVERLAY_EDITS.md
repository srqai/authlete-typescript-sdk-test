# Who Made the Overlay Edits?

## Answer

**You (Shariq Nazr) made the edits** via the Speakeasy platform UI, not Speakeasy automatically.

### Evidence:

1. **All commits are yours**: 
   - `4aa442a` Shariq Nazr - publish (Oct 20 02:08:41)
   - `75da8c1` Shariq Nazr - spec added (Oct 20 01:33:09) 
   - `85519d9` Shariq Nazr - add initial TypeScript SDK files (Oct 20 01:25:47)
   - `27185a9` Shariq Nazr - first commit (Oct 20 01:04:51)

2. **Overlay timestamp**: `1760903983516` = Oct 20, 2025 00:59:43 PKT
   - This was **before** your first commit (01:04:51)
   - So you created the overlay modifications **before** committing the SDK

3. **All 77 modifications are `type: method-name`**: These are manual method name improvements, not automatic suggestions

## What Happened

Based on the timeline:

1. **00:59:43** - You used Speakeasy platform UI to create method name improvements
2. **01:04:51** - You committed the initial files (including the overlay)
3. **01:25:47** - You added the TypeScript SDK files
4. **01:33:09** - You added the spec
5. **02:08:41** - You published

## Did Speakeasy Suggest Them?

**No, Speakeasy did not automatically suggest these edits.** 

The overlay shows:
- **Before**: `sdk.Client Management.client_secret_refresh_api()`
- **After**: `sdk.clients.refreshSecret()`

These are **manual improvements** you made to:
1. **Better method names**: `refreshSecret()` vs `client_secret_refresh_api()`
2. **Better groupings**: `clients` vs `Client Management`
3. **CamelCase**: `refreshSecret` vs `client_secret_refresh_api`

## How You Made Them

You likely:
1. Generated the initial SDK with Speakeasy
2. Saw the auto-generated method names were verbose/unclear
3. Used Speakeasy's platform UI to manually improve them
4. Applied the changes to the registry
5. Synced them to your local overlay file

## Summary

- **Who**: You (Shariq Nazr)
- **When**: Oct 20, 2025 00:59:43 PKT
- **How**: Speakeasy platform UI (manual edits)
- **Why**: Improve SDK method names and groupings for better developer experience
- **Not automatic**: These were intentional manual improvements

The overlay represents your **intentional design decisions** to make the SDK more developer-friendly than the auto-generated version.
