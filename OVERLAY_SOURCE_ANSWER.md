# How the Speakeasy Overlay Was Created

## Answer

The overlay was **NOT manually created in your repo**. It was **auto-synced from the Speakeasy registry**.

### Evidence:

1. **Registry Source**: Look at `.speakeasy/workflow.yaml`:
   ```yaml
   registry:
       location: registry.speakeasyapi.dev/authlete/sdk-workspace/authlete-api-explorer
   ```

2. **All actions have same timestamp**: All 77+ modifications have timestamp `1760903983516` (Oct 20, 2025 00:59:43 PKT)

3. **Overlay already in initial commit**: The overlay file existed when the SDK was first committed on Oct 20

4. **Git history**: No commits mention creating or modifying the overlay manually

## How It Was Created

The overlay was created via **Speakeasy Platform UI** and synced to your registry. Here's the workflow:

1. Someone used the **Speakeasy web dashboard**
2. Made modifications to improve SDK structure (method names, groupings)
3. These changes were saved to the registry at `registry.speakeasyapi.dev/authlete/sdk-workspace/authlete-api-explorer`
4. When you ran `speakeasy generate` or `speakeasy registry pull`, it synced the overlay from the registry to your local `.speakeasy/speakeasy-modifications-overlay.yaml`

## How to Check/Modify the Overlay

### Option 1: Via Speakeasy Registry (Recommended)
```bash
# Pull latest from registry
speakeasy registry pull

# Push changes back to registry (if you have access)
speakeasy registry push
```

### Option 2: Compare and Generate Locally
If you want to regenerate the overlay to match different groups:

```bash
# Compare original spec with a modified spec
speakeasy overlay compare \
  --before en3-referenced.yaml \
  --after modified-spec.yaml \
  --out .speakeasy/new-overlay.yaml
```

### Option 3: Edit Locally
You can manually edit `.speakeasy/speakeasy-modifications-overlay.yaml` to adjust groupings and names.

## Summary

- **Created**: In Speakeasy platform UI (registry)
- **Synced**: Auto-synced when running Speakeasy commands
- **Purpose**: Optimize SDK structure for better developer UX
- **Issue**: Creates mismatch between spec tags and SDK groups

The overlay is **intentionally different** from the spec to provide a better SDK structure!
