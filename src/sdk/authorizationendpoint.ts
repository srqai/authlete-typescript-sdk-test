  /**
   * Fail Authorization Request
   *
   * @remarks
   * This API generates a content of an error authorization response that the authorization server implementation
   * returns to the client application.
   * ### Description
   * This API is supposed to be called from within the implementation of the authorization endpoint of the service
   * in order to generate an error response to the client application.
   * The description of the `/auth/authorization` API describes the timing when this API should be called.
   * The response from `/auth/authorization/fail` API has some parameters.
   * Among them, it is `action` parameter that the authorization server implementation should check first because
   * it denotes the next action that the authorization server implementation should take.
   * According to the value of `action`, the authorization server implementation must take the steps described below.
   * **INTERNAL\_SERVER\_ERROR**
   * When the value of `action` is `INTERNAL\_SERVER\_ERROR`, it means that the request from the authorization
   * server implementation was wrong or that an error occurred in Authlete.
   * In either case, from the viewpoint of the client application, it is an error on the server side.
   * Therefore, the service implementation should generate a response to the client application with
   * HTTP status of "500 Internal Server Error". Authlete recommends `application/json` as the content type.
   * The value of `responseContent` is a JSON string which describes the error, so it can be used
   * as the entity body of the response.
   * The following illustrates the response which the service implementation should generate and return
   * to the client application.
   * ```
   * HTTP/1.1 500 Internal Server Error
   * Content-Type: application/json
   * Cache-Control: no-store
   * Pragma: no-cache
   * {responseContent}
   * ```
   * The endpoint implementation may return another different response to the client application since
   * "500 Internal Server Error" is not required by OAuth 2.0.
   * **BAD\_REQUEST**
   * When the value of `action` is `BAD\_REQUEST`, it means that the ticket is no longer valid (deleted
   * or expired) and that the reason of the invalidity was probably due to the end-user's too-delayed
   * response to the authorization UI.
   * A response with HTTP status of "400 Bad Request" should be returned to the client application and
   * Authlete recommends `application/json` as the content type.
   * The value of `responseContent` is a JSON string which describes the error, so it can be used
   * as the entity body of the response.
   * The following illustrates the response which the service implementation should generate and return
   * to the client application.
   * ```
   * HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
   * Content-Type: application/json
   * Cache-Control: no-store
   * Pragma: no-cache
   * {responseContent}
   * ```
   * The endpoint implementation may return another different response to the client application since
   * "400 Bad Request" is not required by OAuth 2.0.
   * **LOCATION**
   * When the value of `action` is `LOCATION`, it means that the response to the client application must
   * be "302 Found" with Location header.
   * The parameter responseContent contains a redirect URI with (1) an authorization code, an ID token
   * and/or an access token (on success) or (2) an error code (on failure), so it can be used as the
   * value of `Location` header.
   * The following illustrates the response which the service implementation must generate and return
   * to the client application.
   * ```
   * HTTP/1.1 302 Found
   * Location: {responseContent}
   * Cache-Control: no-store
   * Pragma: no-cache
   * ```
   * **FORM**
   * When the value of `action` is `FORM`, it means that the response to the client application must be 200 OK
   * with an HTML which triggers redirection by JavaScript.
   * This happens when the authorization request from the client application contained `response\_mode=form\_post`.
   * The value of `responseContent` is an HTML which can be used as the entity body of the response.
   * The following illustrates the response which the service implementation must generate and return
   * to the client application.
   * ```
   * HTTP/1.1 200 OK
   * Content-Type: text/html;charset=UTF-8
   * Cache-Control: no-store
   * Pragma: no-cache
   * {responseContent}
   * ```
