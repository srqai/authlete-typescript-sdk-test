   * Register Client
   *
   * @remarks
   * Register a client. This API is supposed to be used to implement a client registration endpoint that
   * complies with [RFC 7591](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7591) (OAuth 2.0 Dynamic Client
   * Registration Protocol).
   *

   * <details>
   * <summary>Description</summary>
   *
   * This API is supposed to be called from the within the implementation of the client registration
   * endpoint of the authorization server. The authorization server implementation should retrieve
   * the value of `action` from the response and take the following steps according to the value.
   *
   * **INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR**
   *
   * When the value of `action` is `INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR`, it means that the API call from the authorization
   * server implementation was wrong or that an error occurred in Authlete.
   *
   * In either case, from a viewpoint of the client or developer, it is an error on the server side.
   * Therefore, the authorization server implementation should generate a response with "500 Internal
   * Server Error"s and `application/json`.
   *
   * The value of `responseContent` is a JSON string which describes the error, so it can be used as
   * the entity body of the response.
   *
   * The following illustrates the response which the authorization server implementation should generate
   * and return to the client or developer.
   *
   * ```
   * HTTP/1.1 500 Internal Server Error
   * Content-Type: application/json
   * Cache-Control: no-store
   * Pragma: no-cache
   *
   * {responseContent}
   * ```
   *
   * The endpoint implementation may return another different response to the client or developer since
   * "500 Internal Server Error" is not required by the specification.
   *
   * **BAD_REQUEST**
   *
   * When the value of `action` is `BAD_REQUEST`, it means that the request from the client or developer
   * was wrong.
   *
   * The authorization server implementation should generate a response with "400 Bad Request" and `application/json`.
   *
   * The value of `responseContent` is a JSON string which describes the error, so it can be used
   * as the entity body of the response.
   *
   * The following illustrates the response which the authorization server implementation should generate
   * and return to the client or developer.
   *
   * ```
   * HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
   * Content-Type: application/json
   * Cache-Control: no-store
   * Pragma: no-cache
   *
   * {responseContent}
   * ```
   *
   * **CREATED**
   *
   * When the value of `action` is `CREATED`, it means that the request from the client or developer is
   * valid.
   *
   * The authorization server implementation should generate a response to the client or developer with
   * "201 CREATED" and `application/json`.
   *
   * The `responseContent` a JSON string which can be used as the entity body of the response.
   *
   * The following illustrates the response which the authorization server implementation should generate
   * and return to the client or developer.
   *
   * ```
