  /**
   * Process Entity Configuration Request
   *
   * @remarks
   * This API gathers the federation configuration about a service.
   * The authorization server implementation should
   * retrieve the value of the `action`
   * response parameter from the API response and take the following steps
   * according to the value.
   * ### `OK`
   * When the value of the  `action` response
   * parameter is `OK`, it means that Authlete
   * could prepare an entity configuration successfully.
   * In this case, the implementation of the entity configuration endpoint of the
   * authorization server should return an HTTP response to the client application
   * with the HTTP status code "`200 OK`" and the content type
   * "`application/entity-statement+jwt`". The message body (= an entity
   * configuration in the JWT format) of the response has been prepared by
   * Authlete's `/federation/configuration` API and it is available as the
   * `responseContent` response parameter.
   * The implementation of the entity configuration endpoint can construct an
   * HTTP response by doing like below.
   * ```
   * 200 OK
   * Content-Type: application/entity-statement+jwt
   * (Other HTTP headers)
   * (the value of the responseContent response parameter)
   * ```
   * ### `NOT_FOUND`
   * When the value of the  `action` response
   * parameter is `NOT_FOUND`, it means that
   * the service configuration has not enabled the feature of [OpenID Connect
   * Federation 1.0](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-federation-1_0.html) and so the client application should have not access the
   * entity configuration endpoint.
   * In this case, the implementation of the entity configuration endpoint of the
   * authorization server should return an HTTP response to the client application
   * with the HTTP status code "`404 Not Found`" and the content type
   * "`application/json`". The message body (= error information in the JSON
   * format) of the response has been prepared by Authlete's
   * `/federation/configuration` API and it is available as the
   * `responseContent` response parameter.
   * The implementation of the entity configuration endpoint can construct an
   * HTTP response by doing like below.
   * ```
   * 404 Not Found
   * Content-Type: application/json
   * (Other HTTP headers)
   * (the value of the responseContent response parameter)
   * ```
   * ### `INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR`
   * could prepare an entity configuration successfully.
   * In this case, the implementation of the entity configuration endpoint of the
   * authorization server should return an HTTP response to the client application
   * with the HTTP status code "`200 OK`" and the content type
   * "`application/entity-statement+jwt`". The message body (= an entity
   * configuration in the JWT format) of the response has been prepared by
   * Authlete's `/federation/configuration` API and it is available as the
   * `responseContent` response parameter.
   * The implementation of the entity configuration endpoint can construct an
   * HTTP response by doing like below.
   * ```
   * 200 OK
   * Content-Type: application/entity-statement+jwt
   * (Other HTTP headers)
   * (the value of the responseContent response parameter)
   * ```

  /**
   * Process Federation Registration Request
   *
   * @remarks
   * The Authlete API is for implementations of the **federation registration
   * endpoint** that accepts "explicit client registration". Its details are
   * defined in [OpenID Connect Federation 1.0](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-federation-1_0.html).
   * The endpoint accepts `POST` requests whose `Content-Type`
   * is either of the following.
   * 1. `application/entity-statement+jwt`- `application/trust-chain+json`
   * When the `Content-Type` of a request is
   * `application/entity-statement+jwt`, the content of the request is
   * the entity configuration of a relying party that is to be registered.
   * In this case, the implementation of the federation registration endpoint
   * should call Authlete's `/federation/registration` API with the
   * entity configuration set to the `entityConfiguration` request
   * parameter.
   * On the other hand, when the `Content-Type` of a request is
   * `application/trust-chain+json`, the content of the request is a
   * JSON array that contains entity statements in JWT format. The sequence
   * of the entity statements composes the trust chain of a relying party
   * that is to be registered. In this case, the implementation of the
   * federation registration endpoint should call Authlete's
   * `/federation/registration` API with the trust chain set to the
   * `trustChain` request parameter.
