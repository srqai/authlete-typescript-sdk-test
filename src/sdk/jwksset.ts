   *
   * This API is supposed to be called from within the implementation of the jwk set endpoint of the
   * service where the service that supports OpenID Connect must expose its JWK Set information so that
   * client applications can verify signatures by the service and encrypt their requests to the service.
   * The URI of the endpoint can be found as the value of `jwks_uri` in [OpenID Provider Metadata](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-discovery-1_0.html#ProviderMetadata)
   * if the service supports [OpenID Connect Discovery 1.0](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-discovery-1_0.html).
