/**
 * Process OAuth 2.0 Introspection Request
 *
 * @remarks
 * This API exists to help your authorization server provide its own introspection API which complies
 * with [RFC 7662](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7662) (OAuth 2.0 Token Introspection).
 *
 * <br>
 * <details>
 * <summary>Description</summary>
 *
 * This API is supposed to be called from within the implementations of the introspection endpoint
 * of your service. The authorization server implementation should retrieve the value of `action` from
 * the response and take the following steps according to the value.
 *
 * In general, a client application accesses a protected resource endpoint of a service with an access
 * token, and the implementation of the endpoint checks whether the presented access token has enough
 * privileges (= scopes) to access the protected resource before returning the protected resource to
 * the client application. To achieve this flow, the endpoint implementation has to know detailed
 * information about the access token. Authlete `/auth/introspection` API can be used to get such information.
 *
 * The response from `/auth/introspection` API has some parameters. Among them, it is `action` parameter
 * that the authorization server implementation should check first because it denotes the next action
 * that the authorization server implementation should take. According to the value of `action`, the
 * authorization server implementation must take the steps described below.
 *
 * **INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR**
 *
 * When the value of `action` is `INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR`, it means that the request from the authorization
 * server implementation was wrong or that an error occurred in Authlete.
 *
 * In either case, from the viewpoint of the client application, it is an error on the server side.
 * Therefore, the service implementation should generate a response to the client application with
 * HTTP status of "500 Internal Server Error".
 *
 * The value of `responseContent` is a JSON string which describes the error, so it can be used
 * as the entity body of the response if you want. Note that, however, [RFC 7662](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7662) does not mention anything about the response
 * body of error responses.
 *
 * The following illustrates an example response which the introspection endpoint of the authorization
 * server implementation generates and returns to the client application.
 *
 * ```
 * HTTP/1.1 500 Internal Server Error
 * Content-Type: application/json
 *
 * {responseContent}
 * ```
 *
 * **BAD_REQUEST**
 *
 * When the value of `action` is `BAD_REQUEST`, it means that the request from the client application
 * is invalid. This happens when the request from the client did not include the token request parameter.
 * See "[2.1. Introspection Request](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7662#section-2.1)" in
 * RFC 7662 for details about requirements for introspection requests.
 *
 * The HTTP status of the response returned to the client application should be "400 Bad Request".
 *
 * The value of `responseContent` is a JSON string which describes the error, so it can be used
 * as the entity body of the response if you want. Note that, however, [RFC 7662](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7662)
 * does not mention anything about the response body of error responses.
 *
 * The following illustrates an example response which the introspection endpoint of the authorization
 * server implementation generates and returns to the client application.
 *
 * ```
 * HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
 * Content-Type: application/json
 *
 * {responseContent}
 * ```
 *
 * **OK**
 *
 * When the value of `action` is `OK`, the request from the client application is valid.
 *
 * The HTTP status of the response returned to the client application must be "200 OK" and its content
 * type must be `application/json`.
 *
 * The value of `responseContent` is a JSON string which complies with the introspection response
 * defined in "2.2. Introspection Response" in RFC7662.
 *
 * The following illustrates the response which the introspection endpoint of your authorization server
 * implementation should generate and return to the client application.
 *
 * ```
 * HTTP/1.1 200 OK
 * Content-Type: application/json
 *
 * {responseContent}
 * ```
 *
 * Note that RFC 7662 says _"To prevent token scanning attacks, **the endpoint MUST also require some
 * form of authorization to access this endpoint**"_. This means that you have to protect your introspection
 * endpoint in some way or other. Authlete does not care about how your introspection endpoint is protected.
 * In most cases, as mentioned in RFC 7662, "401 Unauthorized" is a proper response when an introspection
 * request does not satisfy authorization requirements imposed by your introspection endpoint.
