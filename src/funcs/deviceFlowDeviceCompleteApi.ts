/**
 * Complete Device Authorization
 *
 * @remarks
 * This API returns information about what action the authorization server should take after it receives
 * the result of end-user's decision about whether the end-user has approved or rejected a client
 * application's request.
 *
 * <br>
 * <details>
 * <summary>Description</summary>
 *
 * In the device flow, an end-user accesses the verification endpoint of the authorization server where
 * she interacts with the verification endpoint and inputs a user code. The verification endpoint checks
 * if the user code is valid and then asks the end-user whether she approves or rejects the authorization
 * request which the user code represents.
 *
 * After the authorization server receives the decision of the end-user, it should call Authlete's
 * `/device/complete` API to tell Authlete the decision.
 *
 * When the end-user was authenticated and authorization was granted to the client by the end-user,
 * the authorization server should call the API with `result=AUTHORIZED`. In this successful case,
 * the subject request parameter is mandatory. The API will update the database record so that `/auth/token`
 * API can generate an access token later.
 *
 * If the `scope` parameter of the device authorization request included the openid scope, an ID token
 * is generated. In this case, `sub`, `authTime`, `acr` and `claims` request parameters in the API
 * call to `/device/complete` affect the ID token.
 *
 * When the authorization server receives the decision of the end-user and it indicates that she has
 * rejected to give authorization to the client, the authorization server should call the API with
 * `result=ACCESS_DENIED`. In this case, the API will update the database record so that the `/auth/token`
 * API can generate an error response later. If `errorDescription` and `errorUri` request parameters
 * are given to the `/device/complete` API, they will be used as the values of `error_description`
 * and `error_uri` response parameters in the error response from the token endpoint.
 *
 * When the authorization server could not get decision from the end-user for some reasons, the authorization
 * server should call the API with `result=TRANSACTION_FAILED`. In this error case, the API will behave
 * in the same way as in the case of `ACCESS_DENIED`. The only difference is that `expired_token` is
 * used as the value of the `error` response parameter instead of `access_denied`.
 *
 * After receiving a response from the `/device/complete` API, the implementation of the authorization
 * server should retrieve the value of `action` from the response and take the following steps according
 * to the value.
 *
 * **SERVER_ERROR**
 *
 * When the value of `action` is `SERVER_ERROR`, it means that an error occurred on Authlete side. The
 * authorization server implementation should tell the end-user that something wrong happened and
 * urge her to re-initiate a device flow.
 *
 * **USER_CODE_NOT_EXIST**
 *
 * When the value of `action` is `USER_CODE_NOT_EXIST`, it means that the user code included in the API
 * call does not exist. The authorization server implementation should tell the end-user that the user
 * code has been invalidated and urge her to re-initiate a device flow.
 *
 * **USER_CODE_EXPIRED**
 *
 * When the value of `action` is `USER_CODE_EXPIRED`,  it means that the user code included in the API
 * call has expired. The authorization server implementation should tell the end-user that the user
 * code has expired and urge her to re-initiate a device flow.
 *
 * **INVALID_REQUEST**
 *
 * When the value of `action` is `INVALID_REQUEST`, it means that the API call is invalid. Probably,
 * the authorization server implementation has some bugs.
 *
 * **SUCCESS**
 *
 * When the value of `action` is `SUCCESS`, it means that the API call has been processed successfully.
 * The authorization server should return a successful response to the web browser the end-user is
 * using.
