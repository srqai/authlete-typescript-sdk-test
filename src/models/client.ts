   *
   * - The scheme of the redirect URI used for Implicit Grant by a client application whose application

   * type is `web` must not be `localhost`. This is checked at runtime by Authlete.
   * - The scheme of the redirect URI used by a client application whose application type is `native`
   * must be either (1) a custom scheme or (2) `http`, which is allowed only when the hostname part
   * is `localhost`. This is checked at runtime by Authlete.
   *
   * **Requirements by Authlete**
   *
   * - Must consist of printable ASCII letters only.
   * - Must not exceed 200 letters.
   *
   * Note that Authlete allows the application type to be `null`. In other words, a client application
   * does not have to choose `web` or `native` as its application type.

   * - The authorization request has the `redirect_uri` request parameter.

  /**
   * Redirect URIs that the client application uses to receive a response from the authorization endpoint.
   *
   * @remarks
   * Requirements for a redirect URI are as follows.
   *
   * **Requirements by RFC 6749** (From [RFC 6749, 3.1.2. Redirection Endpoint](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6749#section-3.1.2))
   *
   * - Must be an absolute URI.
   * - Must not have a fragment component.
   *
   * **Requirements by OpenID Connect** (From "[OpenID Connect Dynamic Client Registration 1.0, 2.
   * Client Metadata](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-registration-1_0.html#ClientMetadata),
   * application_type")
   *
   * - The scheme of the redirect URI used for Implicit Grant by a client application whose application
   * is `web` must be `https`. This is checked at runtime by Authlete.
   * - The hostname of the redirect URI used for Implicit Grant by a client application whose application
   * type is `web` must not be `localhost`. This is checked at runtime by Authlete.
   * - The scheme of the redirect URI used by a client application whose application type is `native`
   * must be either (1) a custom scheme or (2) `http`, which is allowed only when the hostname part
   * is `localhost`. This is checked at runtime by Authlete.
   *
   * **Requirements by Authlete**
   *
   * - Must consist of printable ASCII letters only.
   * - Must not exceed 200 letters.
   *
   * Note that Authlete allows the application type to be `null`. In other words, a client application
   * does not have to choose `web` or `native` as its application type.
   * If the application type is `null`, the requirements by OpenID Connect are not checked at runtime.
   *
   * An authorization request from a client application which has not registered any redirect URI
   * fails unless at least all the following conditions are satisfied.
   *
   * - The client type of the client application is `confidential`.
   * - The value of `response_type` request parameter is `code`.
   * - The authorization request has the `redirect_uri` request parameter.
   * - The value of `scope` request parameter does not contain `openid`.
   *
   * RFC 6749 allows partial match of redirect URI under some conditions (see [RFC 6749, 3.1.2.2.
   * Registration Requirements](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6749#section-3.1.2.2) for
   * details), but OpenID Connect requires exact match.
