  /**
   * Whether to always retrieve client metadata in the CIMD context regardless of the cache's validity.
   *
   * @remarks
   *
   * Under normal circumstances, client metadata retrieved from the location referenced by the client ID is stored in the database with an expiration time calculated using HTTP caching mechanisms (see [RFC 9111 HTTP Caching](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9111.html)). Until that expiration time is reached, Authlete does not attempt to retrieve the client metadata again.
   *
   * When this flag is set to `true`, Authlete retrieves the client metadata regardless of the cache's validity.
   *
   * If this flag is included in an Authlete API call and its value is `true`, it takes precedence over the corresponding service configuration (see `Service.cimdAlwaysRetrieved`).
   *
   * This flag is effective only when the service supports CIMD (see `Service.clientIdMetadataDocumentSupported`) and CIMD is actually used to resolve client metadata. For example, if the client ID in a request does not appear to be a valid URI, CIMD will not be used even if the service is configured to support it. In such cases, this flag has no effect.
   *
   * Client metadata retrieval is performed only in the initiating request of an authorization flow, and not in any subsequent requests. For example, in the authorization code flow, metadata may be retrieved during the authorization request, but not during the subsequent token request. In contrast, in the client credentials flow, metadata retrieval may occur because the token request itself is the initiating request in the flow.

  /**
   * Whether to allow the `http` scheme in client IDs in the CIMD context.
   *
   * @remarks
   *
   * The specification requires the `https` scheme, but if this flag is set to `true`, Authlete also allows the `http` scheme. The main purpose of this option is to make development easier for developers who run CIMD-enabled servers and a web server publishing client metadata on their local machines without TLS.
   *
   * Given this purpose, it is not recommended to enable this option in production environments unless an allowlist is used (see `Service.cimdAllowlistEnabled`).
   *
   * If this flag is included in an Authlete API call and its value is `true`, it takes precedence over the corresponding service configuration (see `Service.cimdHttpPermitted`).

  /**
   * Whether to allow a query component in client IDs in the CIMD context.
   *
   * @remarks
   *
   * Although the specification states that a client ID "SHOULD NOT include a query string component," it does technically allow it. However, query components are prone to misuse. Therefore, Authlete does not allow them by default. Setting this flag to `true` relaxes that restriction.
   *
   * If this flag is included in an Authlete API call and its value is `true`, it takes precedence over the corresponding service configuration (see `Service.cimdQueryPermitted`).
