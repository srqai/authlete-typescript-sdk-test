 * - as `authorizationEncryptionAlg` value, it refers to the encoding algorithm used by server for transporting they keys on JARM objects
 * - as `requestEncryptionAlg` value, it refers to the expected key transport encoding algorithm that server expect from client when encrypting a Request Object
 * - as `idTokenEncryptionAlg` value, it refers to the algorithm used by the server to key transport of id_tokens
