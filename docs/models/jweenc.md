  - as `authorizationEncryptionEnc` value, it refers to the encryption algorithm used by server when creating a JARM response
  - as `requestEncryptionEnc` value, it refers to the expected encryption algorithm used by the client when encrypting a Request Object
  - as `idTokenEncryptionEnc` value, it refers to the algorithm used by the server to encrypt id_tokens
