# Why the Push Didn't Trigger Generate Workflow

## The Problem

Your push didn't trigger the generate workflow because:

### 1. **Workflow Only Runs on Pull Requests**

Looking at `.github/workflows/sdk_generation.yaml`:

```yaml
"on":
  workflow_dispatch:  # Manual trigger only
  schedule:          # Daily at midnight
  pull_request:      # Only on PRs with labels
    types:
      - labeled
      - unlabeled
```

**No `push` trigger!** The workflow doesn't run on direct pushes to main.

### 2. **Files Changed Are Not Monitored**

The workflow only monitors:
- Changes to spec files (`.yaml`, `.json`)
- Changes to `.speakeasy/gen.lock`
- PR labels

Your changes were:
- `ENDPOINT_GROUPING_ANALYSIS.md` - Documentation (not monitored)
- `HOW_TO_FIX_OVERLAY.md` - Documentation (not monitored)
- `OVERLAY_SOURCE_ANSWER.md` - Documentation (not monitored)
- `WHO_MADE_OVERLAY_EDITS.md` - Documentation (not monitored)
- `.speakeasy/workflow.yaml` - Workflow config (not monitored)
- `.speakeasy/authlete-api-with-examples.yaml` - Spec file (monitored but workflow doesn't trigger on push)

### 3. **Publish Workflow Only Runs on `.speakeasy/gen.lock` Changes**

The publish workflow (`sdk_publish.yaml`) runs on:
```yaml
push:
  branches:
    - main
  paths:
    - .speakeasy/gen.lock  # Only this specific file
```

You didn't change `gen.lock`, so publish didn't run either.

## How to Trigger Generation

### Option 1: Create a Pull Request

1. Create a new branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/update-workflow
   ```

2. Make your changes

3. Push and create a PR

4. The workflow will run on the PR

### Option 2: Manual Trigger

1. Go to GitHub Actions tab
2. Select "Generate" workflow
3. Click "Run workflow"
4. Choose "Force generation" if needed

### Option 3: Add `push` Trigger

Modify `.github/workflows/sdk_generation.yaml`:

```yaml
"on":
  workflow_dispatch:
    # ... existing ...
  schedule:
    - cron: 0 0 * * *
  pull_request:
    types:
      - labeled
      - unlabeled
  push:  # ADD THIS
    branches:
      - main
    paths:
      - '**/*.yaml'
      - '**/*.yml'
      - '.speakeasy/**'
```

### Option 4: Use Webhook

The Speakeasy platform can trigger regeneration when spec changes are detected.

## Why This Design?

The current design is **intentional**:
- Prevents accidental regenerations on every commit
- Forces you to review changes via PR
- Avoids generating on documentation-only commits
- Uses lock file to track when actual SDK changes occurred

## Recommendation

**Add a `push` trigger** if you want automatic generation on spec changes:

1. Edit `.github/workflows/sdk_generation.yaml`
2. Add the `push` section shown above
3. Commit and push
4. Future pushes will trigger generation

Or **use PRs** for better control and review.
